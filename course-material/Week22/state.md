## counter

create a counter component that has two buttons and a paragraph tag. The paragraph tag should represent the screen of the counter, displaying the number that the counter is currently on.

One button should say "add one", and when it is clicked it should add one to the counter value.

The other button should say "minus one", and when clicked it should minus one from the counter value.

if counter value gets to ten, show and extra paragraph text that says " you got to TEN!"
