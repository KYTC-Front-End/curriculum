## üìç Planning Phase

At this phase, what you need to do is the following:

- Look at and understand the project idea . 
- You and your teammates discuss the design and what you should do using Figma to start design . 
- After Design  Divide the project among you - each person has a task to do to complete the project
- After agreeing on the division, move to the build phase

### üìç Build Phase #1

One of the team members has to create a new repository on the KYTC organizition , your repository should contain the following:

- README file with these three points :
  * WHO (team members).
  * WHY (describing the purpose).
  * WHAT (describing your site).
  * HOW (describing the journey to completion).

- Issues: 
  * an issue for every task 
     - issue name is the task name
    - add a little description to the issue to explain the task
  * assign the member who will do the task 
  * add label

###  üìç Build Phase #2
One of the team members has to clone the repository and with the team help, create the file structure *(don't forget to create a new branch for that task)*.

Push the files and open a pull request and wait for the approval from  team members. after merging every member can clone the repo! 

---
 ## üìç Publishing
On completion, your site should be published via github pages. You may decide to publish early *(perhaps to check how it looks on mobile, tablet, etc)*.

Your README should also include a link to the live site and Figma design

## üìç Tips


- You may encounter merge conflicts when working together on the same files. Don't panic, discuss the conflicts with your team before reaching a resolution.


- If you decide to use and stick to a particular naming convention for your CSS classes before starting the project then that's awesome! At the very least, aim to organize your CSS rules so they grouped together well and use clear descriptive class names.


- You should consider installing the Prettier plugin (code format) in your editors to ensure your team code is consistent. An easy step by step guide can be found here: https://prettier.io/.
