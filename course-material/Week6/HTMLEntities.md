## HTML Entities 
Reserved characters in HTML must be replaced with character entities.

Some characters are reserved in HTML.

If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags.

Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.

A character entity looks like this:

    &_entity_name_;
    
    OR
    
    &#_entity_number_;
Example : 
To display a less than sign (<) we must write:  **&lt;**  or  **&#60;**
**Advantage of using an entity name:** An entity name is easy to remember.  
**Disadvantage of using an entity name:** Browsers may not support all entity names, but the support for entity numbers is good.


### Non-breaking Space

A commonly used entity in HTML is the non-breaking space:  **&nbsp;**

A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new line.
