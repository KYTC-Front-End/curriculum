## HTML Editors 
An HTML editor is a specialized piece of software that assists in the creation of HTML code. Similar to text editors such as Notepad and TextEdit, HTML editors allow users to enter raw text.

**Learn HTML Using Notepad** 

 1. Open Notepad 
 2. Write some HTML 

```<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Hello KYTC world </h1>

</body>
</html>
```
 3.  Save the HTML Page 
Name the file  **"index.htm"**  and set the encoding to  **UTF-8**  (which is the preferred encoding for HTML files).
 4. View the HTML page in your browser 

## Example HTML Editors

### Online Editors

Here's an example of an  [online HTML editor](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/online_html_editor.php)  that has been embedded right into this website.

And here's  [another example](https://www.quackit.com/html/online-html-editor/full/)  of an online editor.

Both of these options enable you to create web pages via your browser, then copy/paste the code to your own project.

### Downloadable Editors

[KompoZer](https://kompozer-web.de/en/),  [CoffeeCup](http://www.coffeecup.com/free-editor/), and  [HTML-Kit](http://www.htmlkit.com/)  are well known HTML editors that include HTML and CSS support, split screen view.
## Advanced HTML Editors

If you intend to code using more than just HTML and CSS, you may find a basic HTML editor very limiting. That's because, many basic editors don't support scripting languages such as JavaScript, PHP and ColdFusion.

Most web developers use more than just HTML and CSS and it can become laborious having to switch between different editors for different languages.

That's why more advanced HTML editors like  [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  are so popular with professional web developers. These types of editors provide an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for building multiple large scale web applications.

### What is an IDE?

AN IDE is a software application that provides features to support software development. There are key actions that define what constitutes an IDE:

1.  Detect and highlight code based on the file type you make
2.  Install linters to check your syntax
3.  Preview code as you type it (in the case of HTML and CSS)
4.  Run programs from within the IDE using a terminal interface
5.  Write your own plugins for the IDE to create custom effects, and share plugins with other users

**Another IDE Example**

 - IntelliJ
 - Vim
 - Notepad ++
 - Visual studio

## Differance between Code Editor and IDE

While both provide the ability to edit code, IDEs provide support for compiling and debugging code. A code editor can open files in different formats for making changes, but they are missing the building and evaluation aspects of an IDE.
