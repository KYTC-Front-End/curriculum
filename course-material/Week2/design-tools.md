  **Balsamiq tool for drawing sketching**
  Balsamiq Cloud is a web-based user interface design tool for creating [wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/learn/articles/what-are-wireframes/) (sometimes called mockups or low-fidelity prototypes). You can use it to generate digital sketches of your idea or concept for an application or website, to facilitate discussion and understanding before any code is written. The completed wireframes can be used for user testing, clarifying your vision, getting feedback from stakeholders, or getting approval to start development.

**What are different between Adobe XD, and Figma**

Figma and Adobe XD are both popular tools for designing digital interfaces, such as websites and mobile apps. While both tools have similar features and functionality, there are some key differences between the two.
Figma is a web-based design tool that allows multiple users to collaborate on the same project in real-time. It offers a wide range of design features and supports a variety of platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Figma is also known for its strong vector editing tools, which make it easy to create and manipulate complex shapes and graphics.

1.  Platform: Figma is a web-based tool that can be accessed on any operating system, while Adobe XD is a desktop application that runs on both Windows and MacOS.
    
2.  Collaboration: Figma is known for its strong collaboration features, where multiple designers can work on the same file simultaneously and comment on each other's work in real-time. Adobe XD also has collaboration features, but they are not as robust as Figma's.
    
3.  Prototyping: Both tools allow designers to create interactive prototypes, but Adobe XD has some advanced features like voice and speech playback that Figma currently does not offer.
    
4.  Plugins: Figma has a larger library of plugins and integrations with other design tools, while Adobe XD's plugin ecosystem is smaller but growing.
    
5.  Pricing:  Figma offers a free plan with limited features, as well as paid plans starting at $12 per user per month. Adobe XD offers a free starter plan, but its paid plans start at $9.99 per user per month.
