CSS comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your source code.


Comments are used to explain the code, and may help when you edit the source code at a later date.

Comments are ignored by browsers.

A CSS comment is placed inside the  `<style>`  element, and starts with  `/*`  and ends with  `*/`:

```
/* This is a single-line comment */  
p {  
color:  red;  
}
```
Comments can also span multiple lines:
```
/* This is  
a multi-line  
comment */  
  
p  {  
color:  red;  
}  

```
